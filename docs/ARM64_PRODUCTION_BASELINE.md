# ios-linuxkit ARM64 production baseline

Date: 2026-05-10
Reviewed: 2026-05-15

## Known-good code

- Code baseline: current local `master`, successor to tagged validation point `arm64-openjdk21-prod-20260513-r6`; this pass includes expanded language/runtime coverage, ARM64 sysreg/FP16 conversion fixes, bounds-checked path/symlink expansion, guest-signal-aware blocking I/O/exit cleanup, socket ABI hardening through ARM64 `SCM_RIGHTS` control-message validation, `fchmodat2(AT_EMPTY_PATH)` coverage, AI CLI startup coverage including community `grok-cli`, and reservation-aware high-address `MAP_NORESERVE` handling.
- Previous tagged production audit baseline: `arm64-openjdk21-prod-20260513-r6` (post-r5 validation point covering 44/44 staged coverage, Benchmarks Game refresh, Java mixed/interpreter probes, and go-gte smoke; current local `master` adds the later Rust/Cargo, socket ABI, AI CLI, `fchmodat2`, and high-address reservation audit fixes).
- Branch: `master`.
- Remote target for this working branch: `https://github.com/rcarmo/ish-arm64.git`; `origin` is configured to this repository for fetch and push.

## Validation artifacts

- Runtime coverage: `/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-runtime-coverage-20260515-132014.md`
  - Result: 49 / 49 passing
  - Includes no-safety-valve/no-NETDIAG Rust Cargo/std coverage, Erlang helper-thread cleanup validation, UDP/TCP socket-option and `sendmsg`/`recvmsg`/`SCM_RIGHTS` ABI coverage, `fchmodat2(AT_EMPTY_PATH)` coverage, high-address `MAP_NORESERVE` overlap regression coverage, and Python/Lua/Java/Clojure/PyPy/Swift/Rust/Erlang/Zig smoke or availability coverage.
- AI CLI runtime coverage: `/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-ai-cli-runtime-coverage-20260515-200605.md`
  - Result: 16 / 16 passing on the Alpine npm lane.
  - Includes unauthenticated install/startup/version/help probes for Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Pi, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and community `grok-cli`; Debian AI CLI remains a separate background lane blocked by glibc/libuv thread creation failures.
- Go Benchmarks Game smoke: `/workspace/tmp/benchmarksgame-go-smoke-20260513-144802.md`
  - Result: 10 / 10 passing
- Default mixed-mode Java Hello smoke: `/workspace/tmp/java-hello-audit-r5-20260512.log`
  - `javac_rc:0`
  - `java_rc:0`
- Production baseline capture: `/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-production-baseline-20260510.txt`
- Local production deployment/post-deploy smoke: [ARM64_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md](ARM64_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Production-readiness notes

- OpenJDK default mixed mode is enabled; no `-Xint`, `-XX:-UseCompiler`, `ReplayIgnoreInitErrors`, `DisableIntrinsic`, or runtime/user-data patch is required for the validated Java smoke.
- The final audit pass also hardens host/guest launch plumbing: initial argv construction is bounds-checked, ELF `PT_INTERP` names are bounded and explicitly NUL-terminated, shebang trimming no longer walks before the optional argument string, and ptraceomatic no longer reads before `getenv("TERM")` while constructing the initial environment.
- ARM64 synthetic non-null read-fault recovery remains compile-time gated by `ENABLE_ARM64_READ_FAULT_RECOVERY` and disabled in production builds.
- Guest self-modifying/JIT-patched code invalidation, `CLREX`, `LDXR` widths, `LDPSW`, `DMB`/`DSB`/`ISB`, per-thread `sigaltstack`, `fchmodat2(AT_EMPTY_PATH)`, high-address `MAP_NORESERVE` reservation overlap, and Python/Lua/Java/Clojure/PyPy/Swift/Rust/Erlang/Zig toolchain startup/codegen or availability coverage are covered by runtime fixtures.
- Host OS differences for sysinfo, thread rusage, fd path lookup, stat timestamp fields, random bytes, thread naming, and memory-pressure hooks are centralized through `platform/platform.h`.

## Rollback point

- Roll back to `2074a6a4` if the exec/shebang/initial-argv audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `c4f10affbc99b0038f45fa659730d669c5b10aa2` if the final logging/mount-option audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `17d68ad6fbcedab918e883c1637f254f384c2a73` if the timed-wait cleanup tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `b38c6239b08270889fc32a33c7095cf376785ba6` if the barrier-audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `0711a849c96889c1225bf4e253607bbd8c4abd7d` if the platform/proc audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `6ea7153e` only if Java C2/LDPSW behavior must be isolated from the Go `sigaltstack` fix.

## Remaining known limitations

- Non-production diagnostic compatibility for ARM64 read-fault recovery exists behind `ENABLE_ARM64_READ_FAULT_RECOVERY`; keep it disabled unless explicitly debugging.
- Native offload and socket/poll implementations still contain host-specific implementation branches outside `platform/platform.h`; the second socket audit hardened Unix socket backing paths, accept/name buffers, send/receive buffer allocation, ARM64 control-message layout/validation, socket-option buffers, and bind-failure cleanup, but broader host-specific socket/poll cleanup remains a future candidate.
- Full x86 guest builds remain outside this ARM64 baseline; an audit object build confirmed `kernel_memory.c.o` no longer leaks ARM64 reservation helpers into x86 compilation, while unrelated x86 build failures remain in ARM64-specific `main.c`/`asbestos.c` paths.
