# ios-linuxkit ARM64 backend — Linux on iOS via native threaded-code interpreter

`ios-linuxkit` builds on the `ish-arm64` fork of [ish-app/ish](https://github.com/ish-app/ish), a userspace Linux emulator for iOS.

The `ish-arm64` work added a **native ARM64 guest backend** to upstream iSH's threaded-code interpreter
(*Asbestos*, formerly called *jit* — renamed upstream in 2024 because it doesn't actually emit
machine code). `ios-linuxkit` is now ARM64-only: the legacy x86/i386 guest backend and its
Linux-kernel/Unicorn debug paths have been removed. The result is a dramatically faster and
more compatible Linux environment capable of running **Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, and native
CLI tools** directly on iPhone and iPad.

> ## 🚢 Production Use
>
> This engine is shipping in **[OpenMinis](https://openminis.app)** as the **shell sandbox**,
> where it has been **stably used by over 10,000 users** to run Linux tools and shell workloads
> on iOS. The numbers and stability claims in this document are grounded in that real-world
> deployment, not just synthetic benchmarks.

> **Naming note**: *Asbestos* is the upstream project's name for its threaded-code
> interpreter (see the upstream commit [`d375656f` "Rename the JIT"](https://github.com/ish-app/ish/commit/d375656f)
> from June 2024). It is **not a JIT** — neither Asbestos nor its predecessor emits machine
> code at runtime. For each basic block it builds an array of pointers to pre-compiled
> native "gadget" functions that tail-call one another (the technique Forth interpreters use).
>
> What this fork adds is an **ARM64 guest backend** inside that same Asbestos infrastructure:
> new gadgets (`asbestos/guest-arm64/gadgets-aarch64/`) that map AArch64 guest instructions
> to a few ARM64 host instructions each — same-architecture dispatch, so each guest
> instruction costs only a handful of host instructions. `ios-linuxkit` now carries only the
> ARM64 guest/backend; the legacy x86 backend and debug tooling have been removed from this
> tree. Some prose below says "JIT" as convenient shorthand — read it as "same-arch gadget
> dispatch," not runtime codegen.

## Why ARM64?

The original iSH translates **x86 (i386) instructions** on an ARM64 host — every guest instruction
must be cross-architecture decoded and emulated. This works well for simple tools but creates
fundamental limits:

| Limitation | x86 (original) | ARM64 (this fork) |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture translation | i386 → ARM64 (cross) | AArch64 → AArch64 (same) |
| Address space | 32-bit (4 GB) | 48-bit (256 TB) |
| SIMD | Partial SSE/SSE2 | Full NEON + Crypto |
| Node.js / V8 | Not possible (needs >4 GB VA) | Supported |
| Go / Rust | Not possible (large VA requirements) | Supported |
| Compute overhead | 15-100x native | 3-30x native |

## Key Changes from Upstream

### 1. ARM64 Guest Backend inside Asbestos

This fork's main contribution. It plugs into upstream Asbestos (the existing threaded-code
interpreter) and replaces the per-instruction cost model: for each guest basic block the new
backend builds a **gadget program** — an array of `unsigned long` values alternating pointers
to pre-compiled ARM64 gadget functions with inline operands. Execution is a chain of tail
calls — each gadget loads the next pointer from the program stream and branches to it
(`br x8`). No executable memory is allocated, no machine code is generated at runtime.
The host-code overhead per guest instruction is a few ARM64 instructions inside the
corresponding gadget.

**Key files:**
- `asbestos/asbestos.c` — Block cache, block management, RCU-like jetsam cleanup
- `asbestos/guest-arm64/gen.c` — Instruction decoder + gadget program builder (~200+ opcodes)
- `asbestos/guest-arm64/gadgets-aarch64/` — Hand-written ARM64 assembly gadgets:
  - `entry.S` — fiber_enter/exit, crash recovery trampoline
  - `memory.S` — Load/store with inline TLB lookup (~12 instructions fast path)
  - `control.S` — Branches, conditionals, fused compare-and-branch
  - `math.S` — Arithmetic, shifts, bit manipulation, NEON/SIMD
  - `crypto.S` — AES, SHA, CRC32 instructions

**Design highlights:**
- **Block chaining**: Sequential basic blocks link directly, skipping dispatch overhead
- **Persistent TLB**: 8192-entry TLB survives across syscalls (not flushed on every entry)
- **Crash recovery**: SIGSEGV inside a gadget redirects to a trampoline for CoW resolution
- **Full NEON**: All 128-bit SIMD operations including crypto extensions

### 2. 48-bit Virtual Address Space

4-level page table (L0→L1→L2→L3, 9 bits each = 36-bit page number + 12-bit offset = 48 bits).

- Supports V8's 128GB+ pointer cage (via `MAP_NORESERVE` lazy reservations)
- Go's large virtual address requirements for heap/stack
- Guard pages at 0x0-0x100000 for V8 compressed pointer safety
- Layout kept compact (stack at `0xffffe000`, mmap at `0xefffd`) for TLB efficiency

**Key files:** `kernel/memory.h`, `kernel/memory.c`, `emu/tlb.h`

### 3. Node.js / V8 Support

Running Node.js on a userspace emulator required solving multiple V8-specific problems:

- **128GB MAP_NORESERVE**: Lazy address reservations that don't consume physical memory
- **Guard pages at 0x0-0x100000**: V8 compressed pointers dereference small integers —
  mapping the low 1MB as readable zeros prevents SIGSEGV
- **V8 binary patch**: 9-instruction code cave patch for `InterpreterEntryTrampoline`
  derived constructor bug (zero emulator overhead)
- **`--jitless --no-lazy`**: V8 flags to avoid Wasm compilation and lazy parsing issues
- **Exit cleanup**: Safety valves for stuck V8 threads during process exit

**Result**: `npm install`, `npm exec`, `npx`, and `create-next-app` all work.

### 4. Host integration

Mechanisms for embedding the Linux guest in an iOS host app:

#### ISHShellExecutor (`app/ISHShellExecutor.h`)

Objective-C API for programmatic shell execution with streaming output:

```objc
[ISHShellExecutor executeCommand:@"pip install requests"
                    lineCallback:^(NSString *line, BOOL isStdErr) {
                        NSLog(@"%@", line);
                    }
                      completion:^(ISHShellExecutionResult *result) {
                          NSLog(@"Exit code: %d", result.exitCode);
                      }];
```

#### DebugServer (`app/DebugServer.c`)

JSON-RPC over HTTP server for guest introspection:

```bash
# List files
curl localhost:1234 -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"fs.readdir","params":{"path":"/usr/bin"}}'

# Execute command
curl localhost:1234 -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"guest.exec","params":{"command":"python3 --version"}}'

# Inspect processes
curl localhost:1234 -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"task.list"}'
```

#### Native Offload (`kernel/native_offload.c`)

Bypass emulation entirely for registered binaries. Guest `execve()` is intercepted and
routed to a native handler or host binary:

```c
// Register handler (call once at startup)
native_offload_add_handler("ffmpeg", ffmpeg_main);

// Now guest `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mp3` runs natively
// Arguments auto-translated from guest paths to host paths
```

Supports both in-process handlers (iOS + macOS) and `posix_spawn` delegation (macOS CLI).

#### Bind Mounts (`fs/fake.c`)

Mount host directories into the guest filesystem:

```c
// Read-only bind mount of host directory
fakefs_bind_mount("/host/path/to/data", "/mnt/data", /*read_only=*/true);
```

Lets host-app code share files with the Linux guest without copying.

### 5. Rootfs Management

- **Alpine 3.23.4 aarch64** with full apk package manager
- **RootfsPatch.bundle**: Versioned overlay system for incremental rootfs updates
- **Polyfills**: WebAssembly polyfill for undici/llhttp, fetch polyfill for HTTP downloads
- **OPENSSL_armcap=0** and **GODEBUG/GOMAXPROCS** injection in `sys_execve`

---

## Build Configuration

| Target | Scheme | xcconfig | Guest Arch | Bundle ID Suffix |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|------------------|
| ARM64 | iSH-ARM64 | `AppARM64.xcconfig` | aarch64 | `.arm64` |
| ARM64 + FFmpeg | iSH-ARM64-ffmpeg | `AppARM64-ffmpeg.xcconfig` | aarch64 | `.arm64` |

The ARM64 target links meson-built libraries (`libish.a`, `libish_emu.a`, `libfakefs.a`) directly
from `build-arm64-release/`.

```bash
# Build ARM64 CLI (macOS, for testing)
meson setup build-arm64-release -Dguest_arch=arm64 --buildtype=release
ninja -C build-arm64-release

# Run
./build-arm64-release/ish -f ./alpine-arm64-fakefs /bin/sh
```

### Linux build + SDL/VNC debug harness

For Linux-side debugging and interactive bring-up, the repository also includes a
native Linux build path plus an SDL/VNC PTY harness similar to the other local
emulator projects.

```bash
# Build the Linux host binary
CC=clang meson setup build-arm64-linux -Dguest_arch=arm64 --buildtype=release
ninja -C build-arm64-linux

# Build the Linux SDL/VNC harness (requires SDL2, SDL2_ttf, libvterm, libvncserver)
CC=clang meson setup build-linux-harness -Dguest_arch=arm64
ninja -C build-linux-harness tools/ish-sdl-vnc

# Run it against an existing ish binary + fakefs
./tools/run-sdl-vnc.sh
```

Defaults used by `tools/run-sdl-vnc.sh`:

- `ISH_BIN=./build-arm64-linux/ish`
- `ROOTFS_DIR=./alpine-arm64-fakefs`
- `VNC_PORT=5907`

The harness launches `ish` under a PTY, renders the terminal via SDL, and exports
same framebuffer over VNC for remote debugging.

### Runtime coverage harness

The local Linux bring-up flow is now captured in the top-level `Makefile` and the
staged coverage script `tests/arm64/runtime-coverage.sh`. Meson is still the
source of truth for build configuration; the Makefile only records the repeatable
commands used during ARM64 runtime debugging.

```bash
# Build both Linux host binaries used for release/debug comparisons
make build-arm64-linux-all

# Run the staged runtime suite against the release binary
make test-arm64-runtime-coverage

# Re-run the same suite against the debug binary when investigating failures
make test-arm64-runtime-coverage-debug
```

Useful knobs:

```bash
make test-arm64-runtime-coverage \
  ROOTFS_DIR=$PWD/alpine-arm64-fakefs \
  REPORT_DIR=/workspace/tmp \
  TIMEOUT_S=120 \
  INSTALL_TIMEOUT_S=1200
```

The coverage script currently exercises, in order:

1. base shell/apk/tmp file I/O sanity checks;
2. a C toolchain smoke test (`gcc --version`, compile, execute);
3. SysV shared-memory/message-queue IPC across `fork()`;
4. high-value syscall gap and socket ABI coverage (`signalfd4`, SysV semaphores, POSIX mqueues, `memfd_create`, `openat2`, `faccessat2`, `preadv2`, `pwritev2`, `process_vm_*`, UDP `sendto`/`recvfrom`, TCP `listen`/`accept`, socketpair `sendmsg`/`recvmsg` including `SCM_RIGHTS` fd passing, `getsockname`, `setsockopt`, `getsockopt`);
5. ARM64 `DCZID_EL0` / `dc zva` sysreg and instruction coverage;
6. ARM64 signal `ucontext_t` layout and null-SIGSEGV delivery coverage;
7. ARM64 `CCMP`/`CCMN` condition-code-15 (`NV`) coverage;
8. ARM64 `DMB`/`DSB`/`ISB` barrier decoding/execution coverage;
9. ARM64 self-modifying-code/code-patch invalidation coverage;
10. Per-thread `sigaltstack` coverage for pthread/Go-style signal stacks;
11. Go (`go version`, `go env`, `go tool compile`, `go run`, `go build`, `go test`);
12. Bun (`bun --version`, local `file:` dependency install, TypeScript run, test, build);
13. Node/npm (`node --version`, `node -e`, `npm --version`, `npm run`);
14. Python (`python3 --version`, eval) and Lua (`lua5.4 -v`, eval);
15. Java (`javac` + default mixed-mode `java`, interpreter fallback) and Clojure (`clojure.main` eval);
16. PyPy and Swift Alpine aarch64 availability probes;
17. Rust (`rustc --version`, direct compile/run, optimized std runtime, `rustc --test`, Cargo build/run/test with threads, atomics, channels, file I/O, TCP loopback, and child processes);
18. Erlang (`erl -version` BEAM startup smoke);
19. Zig (`zig version`, `zig build-obj`, linked object execution through a C harness).

Each run writes a Markdown report named
`ish-arm64-runtime-coverage-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` under `REPORT_DIR`. The suite is
intentionally red during bring-up: failures are treated as emulator/runtime bugs
to debug, not as cases to skip.

Current Linux-host status from this pass:

- Latest staged Alpine run: **83 / 83 passing** (`/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-runtime-coverage-20260519-205257.md`, `TIMEOUT_S=120`, `INSTALL_TIMEOUT_S=1200`).
- Latest CLI corner-case smoke baseline: **57 pass / 2 unsupported / 0 fail**; `dig` now completes real UDP DNS through the BIND/libuv `IP_RECVERR`/`IPV6_RECVERR` path, leaving only Docker daemon/container rows unsupported.
- Latest Alpine npm CLI package run: **16 / 16 passing** (`/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-cli-package-runtime-coverage-20260515-200605.md`, unauthenticated install/startup/version/help probes).
- Production package baseline: [ARM64_PRODUCTION_BASELINE.md](ARM64_PRODUCTION_BASELINE.md) (`alpine-arm64-fakefs` on Alpine 3.23.4 with OpenJDK 21.0.10_p7-r0, Go 1.25.10, Docker 29.5.1; current `go` branch after the ARM64-only cleanup; `origin` is configured for `rcarmo/ios-linuxkit`).
- Non-trivial workload probes are grouped in [ARM64_WORKLOAD_SMOKE_TESTS.md](ARM64_WORKLOAD_SMOKE_TESTS.md): Bun workspace/server, `rcarmo/go-gte`, the Benchmarks Game rows, and Node/Bun executor timing/diagnostic gates.
- C coverage is green: `gcc --version`, compile, and execute all pass.
- SysV IPC coverage is green: shared memory and message queues work across `fork()`.
- High-value syscall gap and socket ABI coverage is green: `signalfd4`, scheduler priority calls, SysV semaphores, POSIX mqueues, `memfd_create`, `openat2`, `faccessat2`, `fchmodat2(AT_EMPTY_PATH)`, `preadv2`, `pwritev2`, `process_vm_*`, UDP `sendto`/`recvfrom`, TCP `listen`/`accept`, socketpair `sendmsg`/`recvmsg` with `SCM_RIGHTS`, `getsockname`, `setsockopt`, and `getsockopt` pass in the staged C fixture.
- ARM64 DC ZVA coverage is green: `DCZID_EL0` reports a 64-byte block and `dc zva` zeros the expected naturally aligned block.
- ARM64 signal ucontext coverage is green: guest SIGSEGV handlers see `uc_mcontext` at offset 176 with correct PC/SP/LR, and null read faults reach handlers instead of being converted to zero loads.
- ARM64 conditional-compare coverage is green: `CCMP`/`CCMN` with condition code 15 (`NV`) now follows AArch64 hardware and performs the compare instead of taking the false-immediate path.
- ARM64 barrier coverage is green: `DMB`, `DSB`, and `ISB` decode to distinct host synchronization gadgets; folded CRm domains use conservative full-system host barriers.
- ARM64 self-modifying-code coverage is green: writes to a previously translated RWX page invalidate stale translated blocks before a subsequent indirect call executes the patched bytes.
- Go coverage is green: `go version`, `go env`, `go tool compile`, `go run`,
  `go build` + execute, `go test`, and Benchmarks Game Go 10/10 all pass; iSH now keeps `sigaltstack` state per thread so Go signal handlers use the correct M/thread signal stack.
- Bun coverage is green: `bun --version`, local `file:` dependency install,
  TypeScript run, `bun test`, and `bun build` all pass. The local `file:`
  install allocator/free-list crash has been regression-tested with 50
  consecutive `RC:0` runs, and `bun -e "console.log(1)"` passed 20 consecutive
  repro runs after the GC shims. `setTimeout`, a minimal `Bun.serve` server,
  and a Bun workspace web-startup smoke also passed.
- Node/npm coverage is green: `node --version`, `node -e`, `npm --version`, and
  `npm run` pass without the previous noisy `pwritev` stubs.
- Python and Lua smoke coverage is green: `python3 --version`, Python eval,
  `lua5.4 -v`, and Lua eval all pass.
- Java and Clojure smoke coverage is green: default mixed-mode `javac`/`java`,
  Java interpreter fallback, and `clojure.main` eval all pass.
- PyPy and Swift availability probes are green by recording that Alpine 3.23
  aarch64 currently has no packaged PyPy or Swift toolchain in the index.
- C# NativeAOT SDK availability is accounted for: `dotnet9-sdk-aot` and
  `dotnet10-sdk-aot` are installed and the default gate reports
  `dotnet-aot-sdk-installed-publish-opt-in`; full publish/run remains opt-in
  because focused probes currently stall in Roslyn `csc` after restore.
- Rust coverage is green for direct `rustc` and Cargo paths: version, compile/run, optimized std runtime, `rustc --test`, Cargo build/run/test, threads, atomics, channels, file I/O, TCP loopback, and child processes pass without safety-valve or NETDIAG noise.
- Erlang coverage is green for BEAM startup/version (`erl -version`). Fuller
  `erl -noshell`/`erlc` module execution remains follow-up work.
- Zig coverage is green for compiler/object paths: version, `zig build-obj`, and
  linked object execution through a C harness pass. `zig test` is kept out of the
  gate because Alpine Zig 0.15.2 fails compiler-rt `f16` comptime compilation
  before guest code runs; this is tracked separately from emulator execution.
- Fixed lazy `MAP_NORESERVE` reservation permissions: `mprotect()` now updates
  reservation metadata, so later demand faults materialize pages with the new
  permissions. This fixed the Node/V8 `0xb00c0000` write fault.
- High ARM64 mmap hints are honored again when they fit in the 48-bit guest
  address space. Bun/JSC heap/cage code stores pointers derived from returned
  high mappings; silently relocating these reservations into low memory corrupts
  allocator metadata.
- Large anonymous `MAP_NORESERVE` arenas are now placed in the high 48-bit address space first, instead of burning the low 4GB mmap window. This removes Bun/JSC startup `ENOMEM` on repeated 1-8GB arena probes.
- High-address lazy reservations are now visible to high-hole allocation, caller-hint rejection, and alignment checks. This prevents later medium Bun/JSC mappings from overlapping an existing `MAP_NORESERVE` reservation and is covered by the staged runtime gate plus the 16/16 Alpine npm CLI package lane.
- ARM64 `fchmodat2` syscall 452 is wired and covered, including `AT_EMPTY_PATH` on both an open fd and `AT_FDCWD`/current directory.
- Fixed the pair-exclusive `STXP/STLXP` gadget clobbering `_pc` (`x28`) while
  loading the expected high word. The standalone `tests/arm64/atomics/ldxp-stlxp.c` now covers both 64-bit and 32-bit pair exclusives and passes.
- Fixed `CAS`/`CASP` decode separation so pair exclusives are no longer misdecoded as single-register CAS. The standalone `tests/arm64/atomics/cas128.c` now passes.
- Fixed ARM64 `CLREX` handling: it now clears both single and pair exclusive monitor state instead of being treated as a NOP, so `STXR`/`STXP` after `CLREX` fail as required.
- Added standalone `tests/arm64/atomics/clrex-stxr.c` coverage for `CLREX` + `STXR`/`STXP` failure semantics (32/64-bit single + pair).
- Fixed `LDXR` size dispatch to use size-matched TLB prep/cross-page paths (8/16/32/64) instead of always routing through 32-bit prep.
- Added standalone `tests/arm64/atomics/ldxr-widths.c` coverage for `LDXRB`/`LDXRH`/`LDXR W`/`LDXR X` near page-end addresses.
- Added trace-gating controls (`ISH_TRACE_GATE_PC`, `ISH_TRACE_GATE_X4`, `ISH_TRACE_GATE_BUDGET`) plus block-entry tracepoints for replay triage; this made it possible to isolate the deterministic crash path through `libjvm+0x34710c`/`+0x3471e4` where iSH returns slot-index-1 (`[x5+936]=1`) object `0xc99b6fd8` before the later `libjvm+0x80334c` null dereference.
- Fixed ARM64 `LDPSW` pair-load decoding/execution. GPR pair opcode `opc=01,L=1` is now handled as sign-extending `LDPSW` rather than zero-extending `LDP W`, and unallocated GPR pair encodings are rejected. This clears the deterministic HotSpot C2 replay crash for `ConcurrentHashMap::tabAt` and lets default mixed-mode `javac Hello.java` complete.
- Added standalone `tests/arm64/loadstore/ldpsw-pair.c` coverage for signed-offset and post-indexed `LDPSW`, including a cross-page pair load.
- Gated ARM64 guest SIGSEGV stack/map dumps behind `ISH_TRACE_FAULTS` so runtimes that deliberately handle null/check traps (HotSpot included) no longer emit production noise by default.
- Stopped advertising optional crypto/LSE features in `AT_HWCAP` until those helper sets are fully coverage-clean; runtimes can fall back to baseline FP/ASIMD paths.
- Added `LDNP`/`STNP` handling by treating non-temporal pair loads/stores like ordinary no-writeback pair transfers. This removes the `0xa8007c3f` illegal-instruction trap seen in Bun TypeScript runs.
- Hardened production-adjacent launch/logging paths during the final audit: bounded `printk`/`die`, exact mount-option token parsing, bounded initial argv construction, safe `PT_INTERP` loading, and shebang optional-argument trimming.
- Added ARM64 `preadv`/`pwritev` implementations and wired syscalls 69/70 to
  remove Node/npm fallback noise.
- Reclassified the earlier `HIGHBITS pc=0xefec3698` noise as an invalid
  diagnostic invariant, not an emulator failure by itself. At
  `/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` `_dlstart+0x15c`, musl executes
  `ldr x3, [x5,#8]` and intentionally loads a 64-bit relocation word such as
  `0x66900000401`, then immediately masks it with `and x3, x3, #0x7fffffff`.
  Because normal AArch64 code can keep 64-bit tagged/masked values in GP
  registers, the per-instruction high-bit tracer is opt-in via
  `ISH_TRACE_HIGHBITS=1` instead of enabled for every runtime run.
- Fixed the Bun/JSC freelist corruption by making ARM64 JIT memory-fault retry
  precise. Faultable load/store instructions now record the current guest PC in
  `fiber_frame::jit_saved_pc`; async host SIGSEGV/SIGBUS recovery and
  TLB/cross-page `INT_GPF` exits retry at that instruction instead of the block
  start. This prevents a fault at `4897440: str x10, [x11]` from restarting at
  `4897430: madd x11, x1, x11, x1` after `x11` has been repurposed as the
  freelist loop pointer.
- Fixed the follow-on Bun script/timer/server execution hangs with conservative
  JavaScriptCore GC shims: `JSC_numberOfGCMarkers=1` and
  `JSC_useConcurrentGC=0` are injected for ARM64 guest processes. The first
  avoids the parallel marker signal-suspend handshake spinning on marker threads
  parked in futex/syscall context; the second keeps Bun timers and `Bun.serve`
  progressing reliably while preserving GC.
- Tightened ARM64 signal ABI details found during the same trace: `siginfo_t` now
  includes the 64-bit Linux padding before `_sifields`, `tkill`/`tgkill` deliver
  `SI_TKILL`, and syscall 240 (`rt_tgsigqueueinfo`) is no longer accidentally
  wired to `rt_sigreturn`.
- Fixed `getdents64` `d_type` reporting for realfs/fakefs/tmpfs/proc/devpts. Bun
  `fs.cpSync(..., {recursive:true})` uses directory-entry types while walking
  trees; returning `DT_UNKNOWN` caused a Bun workspace bootstrap copy
  to try `copyfile` on subdirectories and fail with `ENOTSUP`.

Immediate plan:

1. keep the Makefile target as the single command for coverage regressions;
2. keep Phase 4 executor work measurement-only/default-off until guarded exits,
   invalidation ownership, and fault-PC behavior are designed and tested;
3. run longer Bun/npm workloads to find the next post-coverage failure instead
   of expanding the suite blindly;
4. finish optional crypto/LSE helper validation before re-advertising those HWCAP bits;
5. revisit JSC parallel/concurrent GC suspension if/when we need to remove the
   `JSC_numberOfGCMarkers=1` / `JSC_useConcurrentGC=0` compatibility shims.

### Host ABI notes

The Linux build now makes the host-specific ABI seams explicit instead of assuming
Darwin-only structures and APIs:

- `platform/host_context_aarch64.h` normalizes the AArch64 signal/ucontext ABI
  used by JIT crash recovery on macOS and Linux.
- `platform/platform.h` now exposes host fd-path lookup, stat timestamps, random
  bytes, `sysinfo`, per-thread CPU usage, thread naming, and memory-pressure
  hooks with Linux and Darwin implementations.
- remaining host-specific branches in native offload, sockets/polling, and low-level synchronization are documented as future cleanup candidates rather than part of the Java/OpenJDK production path.

## Performance

Historical x86-vs-ARM64 measurements were generated before the ARM64-only cleanup with the
now-retired comparison harness on macOS 26.4.1 / Apple Silicon using guest-side timing
(startup overhead excluded). They remain useful as provenance for why the ARM64 backend
became the only supported guest. Full archived details are in
**[benchmark/BENCHMARK_PERF.md](benchmark/BENCHMARK_PERF.md)**.

### Overhead vs Native (by workload)

| Category | x86/Native | ARM64/Native | **ARM64 vs x86** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| C (pure compute) | 14-208x | 1-66x | **1.1-12.0x** |
| Shell pipelines | 57-305x | 3-42x | **5.3-7.2x** |
| Python | 12-201x | 3.8-169x | **3.8-10.2x** |
| Go (startup) | 10-26x | 2.5-3.1x | **2.5-3.1x** |
| Node.js | — | 1.6-20.8x | N/A (x86 broken) |

### Headline numbers (compute-heavy)

- **C `int_arith_2M`**: ARM64 **12.0x faster** than x86 (65ms vs 782ms)
- **Python `sum(1M)`**: ARM64 **10.2x faster** (610ms vs 6200ms)
- **Python `fib(30)`**: ARM64 **9.2x faster** (1661ms vs 15219ms)
- **Shell `seq+awk 100K`**: ARM64 **7.2x faster** (882ms vs 6338ms)
- **C `matrix_64x64`** / **`mem_seq_4MB`**: near-native speed on ARM64 (~1.1-1.5x)

> **Why ARM64 wins**: same-architecture gadget dispatch (each guest instruction costs only a
> few ARM64 host instructions inside its gadget), full NEON + crypto extensions, 48-bit
> address space for V8/Go/Rust, and Node.js-specific fixes (V8 binary patch, guard pages,
> `--jitless` injection, and syscall coverage). These historical comparisons explain why the
> legacy x86 guest/backend was retired from `ios-linuxkit`.

## Compatibility

The archived compatibility comparison covered 205 tests across 18 categories (Core OS,
FileOps, Text, Build, Python, Node.js, Go/Rust/Perl/…, Network, VCS, Editors, Shell, DB,
Media, Crypto, SysMon, Debug, PkgMgr, Signal). The historical report remains under
**[benchmark/BENCHMARK_COMPAT.md](benchmark/BENCHMARK_COMPAT.md)**; current gates are the
ARM64 runtime and workload smoke suites described in [RUNTIME_VALIDATION.md](RUNTIME_VALIDATION.md)
and [ARM64_WORKLOAD_SMOKE_TESTS.md](ARM64_WORKLOAD_SMOKE_TESTS.md).

| Architecture | Pass | Fail | Rate |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **legacy x86** (Jitter, threaded-code) | 201 | 4 | **98%** |
| **ARM64** (Asbestos, threaded-code) | 205 | 0 | **100%** |

The legacy x86 row is historical only; the current source tree no longer builds or ships that
backend.

## Commit History

This branch has accumulated a focused ARM64 bring-up stack on top of upstream iSH; exact commit/file counts vary as the production audit is rebased and documented, so treat the list below as the durable milestone map rather than a static diffstat.

Major milestones:
1. **Interpreter foundation**: fiber_enter/exit, basic block compilation (to gadget program), TLB
2. **Instruction coverage**: 200+ ARM64 opcodes including full NEON/Crypto
3. **48-bit address space**: 4-level page table, lazy reservations
4. **Node.js support**: V8 guard pages, MAP_NORESERVE, binary patch, exit cleanup
5. **Go support**: Signal frame alignment, per-thread `sigaltstack`, sigreturn fixes, NZCV preservation
6. **Rust/uv support**: FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET, PMULL, BFM, demand-mapped reads
7. **Host integration**: ISHShellExecutor, DebugServer, Native Offload, Bind Mounts
8. **Stability**: 50+ bug fixes for concurrency, memory leaks, use-after-free, deadlocks
9. **Executor performance pass** (2026-05-22): adjacent same-page `fiber_ret_chain` fast path; `GEN_INTERNAL_CONTINUE_MAX` 4→6. Net: −6.6% shell loop, −2.3% Bun JSON.
