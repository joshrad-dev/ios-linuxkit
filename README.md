# ios-linuxkit

`ios-linuxkit` is a Linux runtime for iOS developers. It packages the ARM64 iSH work into a developer-focused environment for running shells, compilers, package managers, language runtimes, and agent/CLI tooling on iPhone and iPad.

The project is based on the `ish-arm64` branch of [iSH](https://ish.app/), but the current focus is no longer just ARM64 bring-up. The emphasis is a practical iOS Linux runtime backed by extensive runtime testing, workload smoke tests, and stabilization of the ARM64 threaded-code executor, Linux syscall layer, filesystem behavior, networking, signals, and modern runtime compatibility.

## What it provides

- **AArch64 Linux guest support** using iSH's Asbestos threaded-code interpreter with precompiled ARM64 gadget dispatch; no runtime code generation, RWX memory, or `MAP_JIT` dependency.
- **A 48-bit guest address space** for modern runtimes that rely on large virtual reservations, including V8, JavaScriptCore, Go, Rust, and JVM-based tools.
- **Developer runtime coverage** across shell, `apk`, C/C++, Go, Rust/Cargo, Bun, Node/npm, Python, Lua, Java/OpenJDK, Clojure, Erlang, Zig, and AI CLI startup probes.
- **Stabilized Linux compatibility paths** for signals/ucontext, futex/thread behavior, vector I/O, `fchmodat2(AT_EMPTY_PATH)`, high-address `MAP_NORESERVE`, socket control messages, `SCM_RIGHTS`, path/symlink handling, and self-modifying-code invalidation.
- **iOS terminal/runtime integration** with the Ghostty-Web terminal frontend, hardened ObjC/JS bridge validation, theme validation, and async terminal callback lifetime fixes.

## Current validation baseline

The current core runtime gate is **82 / 82 passing** on the Alpine ARM64 fakefs, with no `SAFETY-VALVE` or `NETDIAG` diagnostics in the latest stable report. A separate AI CLI npm-lane suite is **16 / 16 passing**, covering unauthenticated install/startup/version/help probes for modern agent CLIs without contaminating the stable core gate.

Additional workload validation includes:

- Benchmarks Game rows passing **10 / 10** for GCC, G++, Go, Python, Node.js, PHP, Perl, Ruby, and Lua.
- Java-equivalent Benchmarks Game probes passing **10 / 10** in both mixed-mode and interpreter fallback modes.
- `rcarmo/go-gte` model conversion, `go test ./...`, and runtime execution.
- Bun/PiClaw bootstrap and web-listen smoke coverage for a real JS workspace/server workload.
- Node/Bun performance and executor-dispatch experiments with opt-in block/prechain statistics.

See [runtime validation](docs/RUNTIME_VALIDATION.md) and [workload smoke tests](docs/ARM64_WORKLOAD_SMOKE_TESTS.md) for the detailed matrix, commands, reports, and failure rules.

## Quick start

Build both Linux ARM64 variants:

```sh
make build-arm64-linux-all
```

Run the staged runtime coverage gate:

```sh
make test-arm64-runtime-coverage \
  ROOTFS_LANES=alpine=$(pwd)/alpine-arm64-fakefs \
  REPORT_DIR=/workspace/tmp \
  TIMEOUT_S=180 \
  INSTALL_TIMEOUT_S=300
```

Run the separate AI CLI coverage lane:

```sh
make test-arm64-ai-cli-npm-runtime-coverage \
  ROOTFS_LANES=alpine=$(pwd)/alpine-arm64-fakefs \
  REPORT_DIR=/workspace/tmp \
  TIMEOUT_S=180 \
  INSTALL_TIMEOUT_S=1800
```

A passing core run writes `ish-arm64-runtime-coverage-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` under `REPORT_DIR`; AI CLI runs write `ish-arm64-ai-cli-runtime-coverage-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`.

## Attribution

`ios-linuxkit` builds on [iSH](https://ish.app/) and the [ish-app/ish](https://github.com/ish-app/ish) project, including its user-mode Linux syscall layer, fakefs/realfs filesystem model, iOS app shell, and Asbestos threaded-code interpreter. The ARM64 backend and runtime stabilization come from the `ish-arm64` fork work in this repository. Original iSH documentation and localized README files are preserved under [`docs/`](docs/) and [`docs/legacy/`](docs/legacy/).
